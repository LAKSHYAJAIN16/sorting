# WASSUP
## Hope You're having a great day
### This is My Sorting Project. It's deployed [here](https://sorting-hub.netlify.app/)
### It's Made using React JS and completely programmed in javascript using The React JSX structure

### It contains some major sorts like :-

- Shell Sort
- Quick Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Heap Sort
- Selection Sort
- Cocktail Sort
- Radix Sort
- Odd Even Sort

It also contains a special sort called Keto sort, which I accidentally invented while trying to make bubble sort.

[Here's](https://github.com/LAKSHYAJAIN16/sorting-git/tree/react-source/src) the code for that if you want lol. It starts from Line 156. Its a mess so please keep that in mind before you see my messy code.

Thanks.
BBYE
